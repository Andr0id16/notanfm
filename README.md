# NotanFM 📂🚀


NotanFM (Not A File Manager) is not just your typical file manager; it's a powerful and customizable tool designed for users who want more than just a graphical interface. Built with JavaScript on Node.js and utilizing the Electron framework, NotanFM brings the familiarity of a file manager together with the flexibility of a command-line interface.

## Features 🌟

- **Command Prompt Integration:** Execute common bash commands like `cat`, `ls`, `find`, and more directly within the NotanFM window.
  
- **Keyboard Shortcuts:** Streamline your workflow with keyboard shortcuts, including the ability to open a terminal in the current directory, navigate the directory tree with arrow keys, and access command history.

- **Customization:** Tailor NotanFM to your preferences with init and config files. Add functionality, tweak settings, and make it truly yours.

- **Iframe Previews:** Hover over PDF and HTML files to preview their contents in separate windows, providing a quick glance without opening additional applications.
